This app brings back memories of watching the Bulls with Michael Jordan.  
I collected his baskeball cards, spending all my money on them.

This app builds a basketball card feel from the base nba-dashboard template.
I configured it to show the specific career stats like a basketball card would show them.

I did try using templates to change the color of the cards, but it just would not work.
I would have loved to make these all red.
